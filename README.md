# 🪟 Clarkston Glass

A modern Next.js website for a local glass company, designed for a sleek user experience and long-term reliability.

## 🚀 Overview

Clarkston Glass is a full-service residential and commercial glass company serving Southeast Michigan for over 30 years. Their previous website was outdated and built on WordPress, and they wanted a modern, faster, and more polished online presence.

This project is a custom-coded solution using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, replacing the old site with a faster, cleaner, and more maintainable build. It's my first custom-coded freelance project, developed for family friends at Clarkston Glass to modernize their online presence.
